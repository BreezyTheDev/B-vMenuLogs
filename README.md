# B-vMenuLogs

## What is it?

This script is quite simple, it logs public net events written inside vMenu's code. Unforunately, I couldn't log all the events but forunately I got some good ones. 

## Configuration

The following can be found in the ``server.lua`` file.
```
Webhook Configuration

webhookmsg = '' -- Webhook for the vMenu message logger.
webhookvmenu = '' -- Webhook for the following events: ClearArea, KillPlayer, & SummonPlayer.
whcolor = '44270' -- 44270 is the preset color.

```
Only thing you have to configure is the webhooks. Feel free to change the preset format written in the code.

I used FSSynthetic's format for the vMenu private message logger. Full credit goes to him for that.
